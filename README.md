#Java Reflection API.
Java Reflection is a process of examining or modifying the run time behavior of a class at run time.
Reflection in Java is one of the advance topic of core java. Using java reflection we can inspect a class, interface, enum, get their structure, methods and fields information at runtime even though class is not accessible at compile time. 
We can also use reflection to instantiate an object, invoke itâ€™s methods, change field values.

In this repository, I've used basic of Reflection API to access private Fields and Methods.
